# 🧠 Modern-to-Shakespeare Translator  
Convert modern English sentences into Shakespearean-style language using NLP and TensorFlow  

## 📜 Overview  
This project uses deep learning to translate everyday modern English into the poetic and dramatic style of William Shakespeare. Built with TensorFlow, it demonstrates sequence-to-sequence modeling techniques for stylistic text generation.

Whether you're a fan of the Bard or just curious about NLP style transfer, this project brings some Shakespearean flair to your machine learning portfolio.

## ⚙️ Features  
- Translates modern English statements to Shakespearean style  
- Built using TensorFlow and sequence-to-sequence modeling  
- Clean, modular codebase for easy experimentation  
- Ready-to-use inference script for generating styled output  

## 🧠 Model Architecture  
- Encoder-Decoder structure with LSTM layers  
- Trained on a parallel dataset of Shakespearean sentences pairs  
- Tokenization and padding for input normalization  
- Sparse Categorical crossentropy loss, Adam optimizer  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- NumPy

## How to use:
Just open the given notebook in a notebook hoster. Run the cells one after the another and you are done!!
Note: Don't forget to download the dataset given in the csv format(Shakespeare.csv)!!!


## 🧪 Future Work  
- Integrate attention mechanism for improved fluency  
- Fine-tune using larger or domain-specific datasets  
- Create a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
